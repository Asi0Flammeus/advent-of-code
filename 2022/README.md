## ADVENT OF CODE -- 2022 EDITION 

Santa needs a lot of *magical energy* to deliver presents on Christmas.

With my in-progress programming skills, I'll help its *not-so-clever* elves in their quest to find a special type of **star** fruit that only grow deep in the jungle. 

Each day you would have to solve 2 puzzles based on a `input.txt`.
